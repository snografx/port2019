# Portfolio 2019, GitHub Edition

This is the repository for my hard-coded professional portfolio, made with Vue.js in early 2019.

It's my first time using Vue so there are a bunch of improvements and optimisations I'd like to make but in the meantime you can check out the live site at http://icyicy.com/portfolio

Here's the Vue.js stuffâ€¦
